# RpcFramework2.0
It's a big step for my RPC framework. Last time , i pushed a RPC framework that used SOCKET to Listen query and JDK Proxy to proxy class. But this time, i bring a band new RPC framework here!


The RpcFramework2.0 contains two REGISTRY---local register AND remote register.

Otherwise, i recoded two Protocols including Http(Tomcat) AND Dubbo(Netty NIO).

Also, it has a simple loadBalance algorithm.

This project still has lots of things to complete,such as SPI and Register Center,and i will continueously commit code here.

Keeping focus on!!!
